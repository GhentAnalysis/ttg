if imagemagick is not available where you're running hepdata_lib, you can convert your images elsewhere:

convert -flatten -density 300 -fuzz 1% -trim +repage inputImg.png adj_inputImg.png
convert -thumbnail 240x179 adj_inputImg.png adj_thumb_inputImg.png

this creates a regualr size adjusted image, and a small thumbnail image, both needed in this form by hepData

add all these images to the output folder, then open the submission yaml file  submission.yaml

for every entry you want to have images add these lines with adjusted image names of course:

additional_resources:
- description: Image file
  location: adj_inputImg.png
- description: Thumbnail image file
  location: adj_thumb_inputImg.png

add these below "---"  and above "data_file: "
yes, this is at the start of each, block, no I'm not sure if that's strictly necessary but might as well do it the way the script would
The "additional_resources:" line is really needed fyi
The resulting block should look like:

---
additional_resources:
- description: Image file
  location: adj_inputImg.png
- description: Thumbnail image file
  location: adj_thumb_inputImg.png
data_file: title_test.yaml
description: Example description
keywords: []
location: Example location
name: Title test
